        <p>On this page you will find a small summary of the poject i did for my 1st semester in my 3rd year oh HBO-ICT at the univeristy of applied sciences Amsterdam(HVA).</p>
        <p> In my semseter 4 others and me where tasked the following:</p>
        <p>In this assignment, students explore the ethical implications of smart technology that actively punishes user behavior. The Smart Home prototype responds to user behavior with such as lowering the heating, 
            blocking the use of accessing devices or turning off lights. This experiment allows users to explore the power relationship between technology and human experience.</p>
        <p>the goal</p>
        <p>Users to experience the control and power of smart technology when it actively punishes them instead of supporting.</p>

        <p>The result of our work was displayed at the exposition of the darktech studio at the HVA. Here we had make a room controlled by our system "Bob",
            you probally already met him at the top. Bob is our Smart home system. giving it a face makes it more interactive for a user, it gives someone to blame... 
            </p>
        <p>Up there was a little demo of what bob can do </p>
