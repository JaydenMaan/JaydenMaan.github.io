        <h2>The project:</h2>
        <p>
            My project group(5) was tasked to explore the ethical implications of smart technology that actively punishes user behavior. 
            The Smart Home prototype responds to user behavior with such as lowering the heating, 
            blocking the use of accessing devices or turning off lights. 
            This experiment allows users to explore the power relationship between technology and human experience.
        </p>
        <p>my group contained:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 AI engineers</li>
            <li>3 Creative technologist</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The goal:</h2>
        <p>Users to experience the control and power of smart technology when it actively punishes them instead of supporting.</p>

                <p>
                    I was assigned to be a creative technologist wich is simmilar to a jack of all trades. I was tasked with a wide viarity of different problems, 
                    <p>such as: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating IOT devices to make a more interactive experience.</li>
                        <li>Designing and creating the software for bob to make it display emotions, be interactive and reachable on a network.</li>
                        <li>comunicating with stakeholders trough product reviews and planning and scheduling the project with my team.</li>
                    </ul>

                    creating IOT devices to make a more interactive experience, 
                    designing and creating the software for bob to make it display emotions, be interactive and reachable on a network.
                    To informing stakeholders and planning with my team

    <h1 id="center">Result</h1>
    <p>
        The result of our work was displayed at the exposition of the Darktech Studio at the HvA. 
        We made a room controlled by our system, "Bob",
        whom you've probably already met at the top. Bob is the face of our Smart home system.
        
        
        Giving it a face makes it more interactive for a user. After the experience, its not just a face 
        its a reminder of the dark side of technology, it gives something to blame... 
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is how Bob works in a production environment. 
        Bob is an AI agent that constantly monitors. 
        He has senses so he can hear, see, feel, Bob can do what you give him. 
        The more smart devices the more control Bob can get. If Bob sees you open ur fridge 5 times within 1 hour, 
        he will actively make a decision to shut the door to keep you from gaining weight. Showering for 1 hour? 
        Bad for you! Bob knows best of course and decides to turn it off...
    </p>

    <p>I think you get concept now</p>
