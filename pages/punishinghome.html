        <h2>Task:</h2>
        <p>
            For this school project my project group(5) was tasked to explore the ethical implications of smart technology that actively punishes user behavior. The Smart Home prototype responds to user behavior with such as lowering the heating, 
            blocking the use of accessing devices or turning off lights. This experiment allows users to explore the power relationship between technology and human experience.
        </p>
        <h2>The goal:</h2>
        <p>Users to experience the control and power of smart technology when it actively punishes them instead of supporting.</p>

    <h1 id="center">Result</h1>
    <p>
        The result of our work was displayed at the exposition of the Darktech Studio at the HvA. 
        We made a room controlled by our system, "Bob",
        whom you've probably already met at the top. Bob is our Smart home system. 
        Giving it a face makes it more interactive for a user, it gives someone to blame... 
    </p>

    <p>
        Up there was a little demo of what Bob can do. So now let me tell you more about how Bob works in a production environment. 
        Bob is an AI agent that constantly monitors. 
        He has senses so he can hear, see, feel, Bob can do what you give him. 
        The more smart devices the more control Bob can get. If Bob sees you open ur fridge 5 times within 1 hour, 
        he will actively make a decision to shut the door to keep you from gaining weight. Showering for 1 hour? 
        Bad for you! Bob knows best of course and decides to turn it off...

    <p>I think you get concept now</p>
